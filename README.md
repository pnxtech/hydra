Hydra is a NodeJS package which facilitates building distributed applications such as Microservices.

Hydra offers features such as service discovery, distributed messaging, message load balancing, logging, presence, and health monitoring. It was announced at [EmpireNode 2016](http://empirenode.org/).

[See our quick start guide](https://www.hydramicroservice.com/docs/quick-start/)

If you're just getting started with Node Microservices and you have ExpressJS experience you should first look at our [HydraExpress](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra-express) project.
